# NYC City Bike Trip Analysis

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of City Bike trips in 
New York City on October 1st, 2013. Using a dataset of over 40,000 
records, the goal is to uncover user behavior patterns, analyze trip 
durations, and visualize the most active start stations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Clean and explore the dataset
- Analyze trip duration and usage by hour and user type
- Determine what percentage of users are subscribers
- Identify the most frequently used start stations
- Visualize station popularity using an interactive map

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: data manipulation with `pandas`, numerical operations with 
`NumPy`
- **Data Visualization**: `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `folium`
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab compatible)

---

## 📈 Key Findings

- **92.03%** of trips were made by annual subscribers
- Trip durations tend to be longer during **7am–12pm** and **5pm–8pm**
- **Subscribers** take longer trips than non-subscribers on average
- The most active start stations are located in **Manhattan**, including:
  - W 17 St & 8 Ave
  - W 45 St & 8 Ave
  - E 43 St & 2 Ave

## 🗺️ Interactive Map

Using `folium`, an interactive map was created to visualize the most 
popular start stations by volume. Each circle's radius is proportional to 
the number of trips starting from that station.
