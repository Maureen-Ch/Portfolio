# NYC City Bike Trip Analysis

This project presents an exploratory data analysis of City Bike trips in 
New York City on October 1st, 2013. Using a dataset of over 40,000 
records, the goal is to uncover user behavior patterns, analyze trip 
durations, and visualize the most active start stations.

---

## üéØ Objectives

- Clean and explore the dataset
- Analyze trip duration and usage by hour and user type
- Determine what percentage of users are subscribers
- Identify the most frequently used start stations
- Visualize station popularity using an interactive map

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies

- **Python**: data manipulation with `pandas`, numerical operations with 
`NumPy`
- **Data Visualization**: `seaborn`, `matplotlib`, `folium`
- **Notebook**: Jupyter Notebook (Google Colab compatible)

---

## üìà Key Findings

- **92.03%** of trips were made by annual subscribers
- Trip durations tend to be longer during **7am‚Äì12pm** and **5pm‚Äì8pm**
- **Subscribers** take longer trips than non-subscribers on average
- The most active start stations are located in **Manhattan**, including:
  - W 17 St & 8 Ave
  - W 45 St & 8 Ave
  - E 43 St & 2 Ave

---

## üó∫Ô∏è Interactive Map

Using `folium`, an interactive map was created to visualize the most 
popular start stations by volume. Each circle's radius is proportional to 
the number of trips starting from that station.

## üìÇ Repository Contents

- `NYC_City_Bike_Trip.ipynb`: Main notebook with code, visualizations, and 
comments
- `README.md`: This file

---

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Open the notebook in Jupyter or [Google 
Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
3. Run all cells to reproduce the analysis and map
